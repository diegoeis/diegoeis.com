Existem poucos livros sobre gestão de produtos que me fizeram pensar quanto o [Product Direction do Nacho Bassino](https://amzn.to/37fQBgN). Não por que o livro é totalmente inédito, mas assim como o Team Topologies, ele me ajudou a colocar assuntos importantes em uma ordem lógica e racional. Eu estou escrevendo um livro sobre desdobramento estratégico de produtos digitais e  com certeza o Product Direction já influenciou muito várias partes do livro.

O Product Direction é um livro direto ao ponto. Nada de firula ou teorias muito avançadas, pelo contrário, ele já aborda os problemas e vai direto para as soluções, um passo a passo maravilhosamente prático sobre como planejar e executar a parte estratégica e de planejamento de produtos digitais.

Aborda uma série de ferramentas, frameworks e abordagens que podem ajudar os PMs e líderes de produto a desdobrarem de maneira prática a estratégia de produto, deixando tudo mais visual, prática e fácil de comunicar pra a empresa.

Senti falta de um nível acima do que foi abordado. Mas essa parte é meio nebulosa mesmo empoce se confundir com estratégia de negócio. 

Com esse livro, eu formo a tríade essencial de livros para gestores de produto. São três livros definitivos e que da 80% da noção do trabalho de gestão de produtos: 

1. [Product Direction, Nacho Bassino](https://amzn.to/37fQBgN)
2. [Outcome over Output, Josh Seiden](https://amzn.to/3ynj7sK)
3. [Team Topologies, Matthew Skelton](https://amzn.to/2VuYXhO)

Esses três livros são uma dimensão realista, prática e útil para pessoas que chegaram agora na área ou para todos que já estão aqui faz tempo.

Alguns fragmentos:

* Your product strategy will build the bridge between the vision and your expected outcomes. It is a combination of: a diagnosis of your current situation a selection of problems and opportunities you are focusing on a set of guidelines for execution
* Essa analogia vou usar certamente em palestras e artigos futuros: “If you are flying at an altitude of 10,000 kilometers, you won’t provide any help to the ground team. The only thing you will see from that altitude is a large grey spot representing the city. On the other hand, if you are operating a drone flying at two meters above the ground, you will have the same visibility as the team, looking for direction, going door-by-door, and you could not offer any strategic guidance. And if you are in a small helicopter flying at 500 meters? You may identify different areas of damage, different buildings, and recognize the city’s limits, all of which will enable the team to understand the scale of the problem and where to start.”
* Sobre Devs e outras áreas em discovery: “It would be awesome to include everyone in the process, avoiding the potential loss of valuable insights. But the practical downside is that you risk the whole process getting caught up in eternal discussions.”
* “Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.” Richard Rumelt, Good Strategy Bad Strategy
* A winning mindset is crucial during the selection step. You do not need to become a world leader brand or have the largest share in an entire industry. But you do need to select a strategy that will enable you to dominate a niche market or compete based on a key attribute that customers value highly.
